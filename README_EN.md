## üöÄ Features

- Remove old likes
- Delete post tags
- Move items to trash
- Works with different types of activity and years
- Automated process with visible browser

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Google Chrome installed
- A Facebook account

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmelkings/fb-activity-cleaner.git
cd fb-activity-cleaner
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## üìù Preparation

Before running the script, you need to:

1. Open Google Chrome and log in to your Facebook account
   - This is important because the script will use your Chrome profile
   - If you don't log in first, the script will redirect to the login page and won't work properly

2. Get the Activity Log URL:
   - Go to your Facebook profile
   - Click on "Activity Log"
   - Select the year you want to clean using the filter
   - Select the type of activity if you want (posts, likes, etc.)
   - Copy the URL from your browser

3. Update the script:
   - Open `src/index.js`
   - Find the URL in the code and replace it with your copied URL
   - Save the file

## üöÄ Usage

Run the script with:

```bash
npm start
```

The script will:
1. Open a Chrome window
2. Navigate to your activity log
3. Start automatically deleting items

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. The process takes time - be patient!

2. Facebook sometimes stops allowing deletion of all activity after extensive use:
   - If this happens, stop the script
   - Wait a while
   - Run it again later
   - This is normal and a Facebook limitation

3. You can use this script for:
   - Different years (just change the URL)
   - Specific types of activity (all activity, only posts, only likes, etc.)
   - Just update the URL accordingly

4. The script uses your existing Chrome profile:
   - Make sure you're logged into Facebook in Chrome
   - Don't use Chrome while the script is running
   - The script will open a new Chrome window
